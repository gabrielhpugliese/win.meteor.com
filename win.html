			<h2>Unofficial support for Meteor on Windows</h2>
			<p>This page provides an overview of the unofficial community supported options for both getting <a href="{{meteor_link}}">Meteor</a> running natively on Windows (a continuation of Tom Wijsman's great work), as well as several near fully automated provisioned virtualized solutions. Thanks, Tom!</p>
		</div>

		<h2>Native Solution</h2>
		<p>Stephen Darnell has picked up where Tom Wijsman graciously left off.  This solution is the most straight forward way to get <a href="{{meteor_link}}">Meteor</a> running on Windows.  There are some trade-offs because this is a fork and can lag behind the latest version as Stephen can update to and test the latest version.</p>

		<h2>Virtualized Solutions</h2>
		<p>There are currently two published <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>-based solutions for near fully automating provisioning of a headless virtualized Linux VirtualBox environment that will run <a href="{{meteor_link}}">Meteor</a> and allow for the editing of the apps using Vagrant's Synced Folders.  This allows for the use of Windows development tools from the local Windows host, and the live updating aspects of <a href="{{meteor_link}}">Meteor</a> are preserved through to the Linux VM.  These solutions require some pre-requisite installation, but have the added benefit of being able to stay at the current version of <a href="{{meteor_link}}">Meteor</a>.  These will also allow for the use of <a href="{{meteorite_link}}">Meteorite</a>.</p>
		
		<h3>Vagrant Shell Provisioning</h3>
		<p>Gabriel Pugliese has posted a guide for how to provision <a href="{{meteor_link}}">Meteor</a> on Linux with Vagrant's Shell Provisioning.  These may be more accessible to users familier with Linux and Shell scripts.  This solution is easier to tweak through the straight forward shell commands than the Chef alternative.</p>
		<p><a href="{{gp_link}}">Vagrant Shell Provisioning Guide</a></p>

		<h3>Vagrant Chef Provisioning</h3>
		<p>Matthew Sullivan is maintaining a set of Vagrant files, Chef cookbook, and guide for provisioning <a href="{{meteor_link}}">Meteor</a> on Linux with Vagrant.  This Chef solution is a slightly more automated and configurable than the shell solution, however likely not as simple to tweak beyond the provided configuration parameters as the Shell solution.</p>

		<h2>Support</h2>
		<p>Bug reports and pull requests are more than welcome and should go to the respective GitHub pages.  Feel free to contact us about any of the above solutions on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/meteor-talk">Meteor-Talk Google Group</a>.</p>

		<div class="warning bottom">
			<p>All these solutions build on the great work of Tom Wijsman, the original author of the unofficial Windows port.  A great deal of thanks goes out to him for his great work and maintenance of Windows support through all of the rapid and sometimes breaking changes in the early stages of <a href="{{meteor_link}}">Meteor</a>, as well as his support in the graceful transition of his work and this page.</p>
