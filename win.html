			<h2>Meteor on Windows is undergoing a Changing of the Guard.</h2>
			<p>This page is being transitioned to provide an overview of the Unofficial community supported options for both getting <a href="{{meteor_link}}">Meteor</a> running natively on Windows (a continuation of Tom Wijsman's great work), as well as several near fully automated provisioned virtualized solutions.  Thanks, Tom!</p>
		</div>

		<h2>Native Solution</h2>
		<p>Stephen Darnell has picked up where Tom Wijsman graciously left off.  This solution is the most straight forward way to get <a href="{{meteor_link}}">Meteor</a> running on Windows with an MSI Installer provided.  There are some trade-offs because this is a fork and can lag behind the latest version as Stephen can update to and test the latest version.</p>
		<p><a href="{{sd_download}}">Download Meteor {{sd_version}} for Windows ({{sd_fileSize}}).</a></p>
		<p><a href="{{sd_github}}">GitHub Repository</a> and <a href="{{sd_wiki}}">GitHub Wiki</a></p>

		<h2>Virtualized Solutions</h2>
		<p>There are currently two published <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>-based solutions for near fully automating provisioning of a headless virtualized Linux VirtualBox environment that will run <a href="{{meteor_link}}">Meteor</a> and allow for the editing of the apps using Vagrant's Synced Folders.  This allows for the use of Windows development tools from the local Windows host, and the live updating aspects of <a href="{{meteor_link}}">Meteor</a> are preserved through to the Linux VM.  These solutions require some pre-requisite installation, but have the added benefit of being able to stay at the current version of <a href="{{meteor_link}}">Meteor</a>.  These will also allow for the use of <a href="{{meteorite_link}}">Meteorite</a>.</p>
		
		<h3>Vagrant Shell Provisioning</h3>
		<p>Gabriel Pugliese has posted a guide for how to provision <a href="{{meteor_link}}">Meteor</a> on Linux with Vagrant's Shell Provisioning.  These may be more accessible to users familier with Linux and Shell scripts.  This solution is easier to tweak through the straight forward shell commands than the Chef alternative.</p>
		<p><a href="{{gp_link}}">Vagrant Shell Provisioning Guide</a></p>

		<h3>Vagrant Chef Provisioning</h3>
		<p>Matthew Sullivan is maintaining a set of Vagrant files, Chef cookbook, and guide for provisioning <a href="{{meteor_link}}">Meteor</a> on Linux with Vagrant.  This Chef solution is a slightly more automated and configurable than the shell solution, however likely not as simple to tweak beyond the provided configuration parameters as the Shell solution.</p>

		<h2>Support</h2>
		<p>Bug reports and pull requests are more than welcome and should go to the respective GitHub pages.  Feel free to contact us about any of the above solutions on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/meteor-talk">Meteor-Talk Google Group</a>.</p>

		<div class="warning bottom">
			<p>The great work of Tom Wijsman, the Original Unofficial Meteor for Windows support, will be kept below for a period of time during this transition and a great deal of thanks goes out to him for his great work and maintenance of Windows support through all of the rapid and sometimes breaking changes in the early stages of <a href="{{meteor_link}}">Meteor</a>, as well as his support in the graceful transition of his work and this page.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<h2>Original Unofficial Meteor for Windows {{version}} and earlier</h2>
	<div>
		<div class="warning">
			<h1>Unofficial Meteor for Windows support has been discontinued!</h1>

			<p>With the introduction of the warehouse (the new distribution system) and the change in installation approach (hackily does that to the user account, completely neglecting any form of user or enterprise package manager) I will no longer produce installers as this is unsustainable. As a consequence of that and that I currently no longer actively use Meteor or Windows, I will not be able to support this any longer myself.</p>

			<p>Those who that wish to continue to use Meteor for Windows can fork the project and attempt to port the patches to newer versions. Those that are willing to continue support may be handed over the win.meteor.com sub domain some time from now, those that contributed (either through code or issues) may get preference when multiple people ask access. Hopefully, we'll see the fixes merge into Meteor in the future...</p>

			<p>To all those who have used Meteor for Windows, thank you; may Meteor continue to shine in the future, whichever way it goes.</p>

			<p>With kind regards,<br /><br />Tom Wijsman</p>

			<p><b>PS:</b> There may be a chance I continue to contribute in the future, albeit in a different way; I'll continue to wear this shirt with pride.</p>

		<h2>Where can I download the latest version?</h2>

		<p><a href="{{download}}">Download Meteor {{version}} for Windows ({{fileSize}}).</a></p>

		<h2>What do I need to do to install this?</h2>

		These instructions will install Meteor on your computer, after a reboot you will be able to run <pre>meteor</pre> like in the instructions; this section therefore replaces the curl instruction found in the <a href="http://docs.meteor.com/">documentation</a> and on the <a href="http://meteor.com">Meteor site</a>.

		<ol>
			<li>Install the above MSI installer.</li>
			<li>Reboot for the environment changes to apply.</li>
			<li>On Windows 8, you will need to set <pre>node.exe</pre> to "Windows 7" <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-compatibility-mode/">compatibility mode</a> in <pre>C:\Program Files\Meteor\bin</pre>. Use the <pre>Program Files (x86)</pre> folder if you are using a 64 bit edition.</li>
		</ol>

		<!--<h2>Where can I report bugs?</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>Report Windows related bugs at <a href="https://github.com/TomWij/meteor/issues">TomWij/meteor</a>.</li>
			<li>Report any other bug at <a href="https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues">meteor/meteor</a>.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Want to clone us and help port Meteor?</h2>

		These instructions are only meant to be followed if you wish to contribute to porting Meteor to Windows, they are not necessary for running Meteor on Windows. 

		<ol>
			<li>Get <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">Git for Windows</a> and do a <pre>git clone git://github.com/TomWij/meteor.git</pre></li>
			<li><p><a href="{{bundle}}">Download the development bundle</a> and place it in the folder you have just pulled, make sure you download any new development bundles once new versions of Meteor get released; they are available in the <a href="https://github.com/TomWij/meteor/downloads">Downloads tab</a> of the repository <a href="https://github.com/TomWij/meteor">TomWij/meteor</a>.</p><p>Alternatively, you can attempt to generate your own using 'sh admin/generate_dev_bundle.sh' from Git Bash.</p></li>
			<li>Run <pre>meteor</pre> from Git Bash in the Meteor folder which will install the development bundle into place.</li>
			<li>Set up environment variables according to <a href="https://github.com/TomWij/meteor/blob/support-windows/admin/wix/Meteor_Template.wxs#L12">these Environment tags</a>, for each environment tag there you have to create or change an environment variable with the name in the Id attribute and add the last Value attribute to it, replace [INSTALLDIR] with the installation directory of Meteor with a backslash at the end. In detail:

				<ul>
					<li><pre>PATH</pre>: Add the Meteor directory as well as its <pre>bin</pre> directory.</li>
					<li><pre>METOR_PATH</pre>: Set to the Meteor install directory.</li>
					<li><pre>NODE_PATH</pre>: Set it to <pre>lib\node_modules</pre> inside of Meteor.</li>
				</ul></li>
			<li>Feel free to start talk to me on <a href="http://meteor.com/irc">Meteor IRC</a> or through an issue to discuss things, to request a pull or when experiencing issues with these instructions.</li>
